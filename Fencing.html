<h1>About My fencing</h1>
<h3> Ive been fencing for about 8 years now, and the type of fencing i do is called Foil</h3>
<h3> Its something I really love and I practive for about 10ish hours a week at my club Moe Fencing Club</h3>
<p>In adition to practicing at my club I also help coach a kids class on saterdays which I find really fun</p>
<p></p>

<p>unfortunatly I dont have any pictures of me fencing that I can get easily but here is a picture of the kind of fencing I do </h2>
<!--the kids i coach are 8-13 years old and i have to say, although im not a big fan of kids, I do really enjoy it-->

<!-- like the buttons, the images are also "in" text, as a jury rigged solution to centering them-->
