<h1>About My fencing</h1>
<h3> Ive been fencing for about 8 years now, and the type of fencing i do is called Foil</h3>
<h3> Its something I really love and I practive for about 10ish hours a week at my club Moe Fencing Club</h3>
<p>In adition to practicing at my club I also help coach a kids class on saterdays which I find really fun</p>
